## What It Does

- **Reads emails** from Gmail and parses content into structured fields.  
- **Classifies intent** using a local LLM (Ollama) and returns confidence scores.  
- **Generates draft responses** based on email intent.  
- **Stores all data** in a database for tracking and filtering.  
- **Provides API access** via FastAPI for querying emails by status or intent.  
- **Interactive Streamlit dashboard** for reviewing emails, filtering, and updating statuses manually.

## Why It’s Portfolio-Worthy

- End-to-end workflow: ingestion → AI classification → response → persistence → dashboard  
- Demonstrates **hands-on AI engineering** and **human-in-the-loop design**  
- Showcases **modern Python stack**: FastAPI, Streamlit, SQLAlchemy, Ollama LLM  
- Ready for recruiters to explore **via API or dashboard**
